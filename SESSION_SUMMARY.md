## 🎓 Learning Progress Impact

### Before Testing Implementation

```
Overall Progress: 45%
Testing Coverage: 0% (CRITICAL GAP ❌)
```

### After Testing Implementation

```
Overall Progress: 55% (+10% 📈)
Testing Coverage: 70% (EXCELLENT ✅)

✅ Unit testing (Vitest)
✅ Integration testing (Database, Redis)
✅ E2E testing (Playwright)

## 🚀 How to Run Tests

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Unit tests (fastest, no setup)
pnpm test:unit

# Integration tests (requires PostgreSQL + Redis)
docker compose up -d postgres redis
sleep 10
pnpm test:integration

# E2E tests (requires all services)
docker compose up -d
sleep 15
pnpm test:e2e

# Coverage report
pnpm test:coverage
```

## 🚀 Next Steps - React Query Implementation

Now that testing infrastructure is solid, the **recommended next step** is:

### **React Query - Frontend State Management** ⭐

**Why Next:**

- Biggest UX improvement with minimal complexity
- Natural complement to tested backend
- Closes critical frontend gap (currently at 20%)
- Modern best practice for server state

**What You'll Get:**

- Automatic caching & refetching
- Optimistic updates
- Loading/error states
- Query invalidation
- Better UX with stale-while-revalidate
- DevTools integration

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours

**Files to Create:**

```
services/relay-client/src/
  ├── hooks/
  │   ├── usePosts.ts      (Query hooks)
  │   ├── useAuth.ts       (Auth mutations)
  │   └── useUpvote.ts     (Optimistic updates)
  ├── lib/
  │   └── queryClient.ts   (React Query config)
  └── components/          (Update to use hooks)
```

**Impact:**

- Frontend: 20% → 40% (+20%)
- Overall: 55% → 60% (+5%)
