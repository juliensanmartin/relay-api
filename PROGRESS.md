## üí° Learning Notes & Decisions

### Decision Log

**October 3, 2025**

- Created `.cursorrules` file for consistent development standards
- Created this progress tracker to monitor learning journey
- Identified testing as critical gap (0% coverage currently)
- ‚úÖ **Implemented Redis caching with Cache-Aside pattern**
  - Created `@relay/cache` shared package
  - Added Redis 7 to docker-compose
  - Implemented caching in post-service with 5-minute TTL
  - Added Prometheus metrics for cache hits/misses
  - Cache invalidation on post creation and upvotes
  - **Phase 1 now 100% complete!** üéâ

### Key Insights

- **Observability First:** Having tracing/metrics from day 1 makes debugging distributed systems much easier
- **Event-Driven Decoupling:** RabbitMQ decouples services effectively, but need to consider Kafka for high-throughput use cases
- **Testing Debt:** Need to add testing before the codebase grows larger
- **State Management:** Current frontend state management is too basic for real-world UX

### Resources Used

- Docker official documentation
- Express.js + TypeScript best practices
- OpenTelemetry documentation
- RabbitMQ tutorials
- PostgreSQL query optimization guide
